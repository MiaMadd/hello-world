Hello humanity, today i'm going to say a little more about me. I have a dog, her name is Luna, she's sweet and crazy and i love her so much. I got a boyfriend, eighteen years older than me, he's handsome, probably the most, and aaalll mine =D. My father is a great dad, but a horrible person with everybody but me and my mother is the completely different, she's sweet, funny, and sometimes freaks out for... nothing, but i love them so much.

Well, that's it, good rest of your life,
Whoever is reading this.
